1. Overview
===========

	 The pro-active routing  protocol Optimized Link State Routing
(described in RFC 3626) is an optimization of the classical link state
algorithm for wireless Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). It provides an
efficient  mechanism  for flooding  control  traffic  by reducing  the
number  of  transmissions   required.  The  protocol  is  particularly
suitable  for   large  and  dense   wireless  networks  as   the  OLSR
optimization works well in this  context. 

	Quagga  is a  routing  software suite  in  which each  routing
protocol  is a  Unix  daemon. This  project  is about  making an  OLSR
implementation for Quagga. For  information about Quagga, please visit
www.quagga.net.

	For  a  richer version  of  this  text  on for  OLSR  specific
commands  and other options  please read  the `readme.html'  file from
directory or from the web at:

2. Installation
===============

	Before  installing  OLSRd one  needs  to  download the  Quagga
sources  from http://www.quagga.net/download.php.  Current  version of
OLSRd has been  tested with Quagga 0.98.5 which  is the current stable
Quagga version  but it will probably  run as well with  older or newer
versions because the Quagga core code changes relatively rare.

	After downloading  uncompress the Quagga sources  and copy the
OLSR tar ball inside the newly created directory.

     $ tar xzvf quagga-0.98.5.tar.gz 
     $ cd quagga-0.98.5 
     $ cp ../quagga-olsrd-0.1.18.tar.gz .

	Now uncompress the  quagga-olsrd-0.1.18.tar.gz file here. This
will create a new directory named olsrd. You will find a patch in that
directory that you have to apply before doing anything else.

    $ tar xzvf quagga_olsrd-0.1.18.tar.gz
    $ cd olsrd/
    $ patch -p1 -d .. < quagga-0.98.5_olsrd-0.1.18.diff 

	The  next step  is to  run the  ./configure script  which will
generate Makefiles  for both Quagga  and OLSRd. Please  use /configure
--help and read the INSTALL file from the Quagga directory. One of the
interesting Quagga  features is  that it can  run as normal  Unix user
providing good security. Read the  documentation about how to enable a
normal  user to  run quagga  or --  if you're  in a  hurry --  use the
following:

    $ ./configure --enable-user=root --enable-group=root
    $ make
    $ sudo make install 

	All remains to do now is to compile OLSRd:

    $ cd olsrd/
    $ make
    $ sudo make install



3. Getting started
==================

	To enable  the OLSR  routing one needs  to start  two daemons:
zebra  which is  the process  responsible for  communicating  with the
kernel and  olsrd. To see available  options use `man  zebra' and `man
olsrd'.   But before  starting the  daemons, you  will need  to create
configuration  files.  For  general Quagga  configuration  options see
http://www.quagga.net/docs.php and  for configuration options specific
to OLSRd read  the next section. For the moment, you  can just use the
samples provided.

    $ cp /usr/local/etc/zebra.conf.sample /usr/local/etc/zebra.conf
    $ cp /usr/local/etc/olsrd.conf.sample /usr/local/etc/olsrd.conf
    $ zebra -d
    $ olsrd
    2005/09/25 05:23:41 OLSR: OLSRd 0.1.18 starting: vty@2611

	Quagga   daemons   can   be   configured  either   using   the
configurations files from /usr/local/etc/  (or other directory at your
option) either  using VTY  shells in an  interactive manner.   You can
connect to  the zebra daemon  on port 2601  and to the OLSR  daemon on
port 2611. If you haven't  changed the password then it's `zebra'. For
basic information about VTYs please read

http://www.quagga.net/docs/docs-multi/Virtual-Terminal-Interfaces.html

    $ telnet localhost 2611
